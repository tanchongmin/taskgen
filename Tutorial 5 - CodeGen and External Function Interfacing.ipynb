TaskGen - is largely complete!\\nNoteable features include:\\nSplitting of Tasks into subtasks for bite-sized solutions for each subtask\\nSingle Agent with LLM Functions\\nSingle Agent with External Functions\\nMeta Agent with Inner Agents as Functions\\nShared Variables for multi-modality support\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) over Function space\\nMemory to provide additional task-based prompts for task\\nGlobal Context for configuring your own prompts + add persistent variables\\nAsync mode for Agent, Function and strict_json added\\nCommunity Uploading and Downloading of Agent and Functions\\nI am quite sure that this is the best open-source agentic framework for task-based execution out there!\\nExisting frameworks like AutoGen rely too much on conversational text which is lengthy and not targeted.\\nTaskGen uses StrictJSON (JSON parser with type checking and more!) as the core, and agents are efficient and are able to do Chain of Thought natively using JSON keys and descriptions as a guide.\\nWhat can you do to help:\\nStar the github so more people can use it (It\\'s open source and free to use, even commercially!)\\nContribute your favourite external function integrations so that it can be much more boilerplate for others to use :)\\nContribute template Jupyter Notebooks for your favourite use cases :)\\nI can\\'t wait to see what this new framework can do for you!\\nBenefits of JSON messaging over agentic frameworks using conversational free-text like AutoGen\\nJSON format helps do Chain-of-Thought prompting naturally and is less verbose than free text\\nJSON format allows natural parsing of multiple output fields by agents\\nStrictJSON helps to ensure all output fields are there and of the right format required for downstream processing\\nTutorials and Community Support\\nCreated: 17 Feb 2024 by John Tan Chong Min\\nCo-developer / Lead Contributor: Prince Saroj\\nCollaborators welcome\\nDiscussion Channel (my discord - John\\'s AI Group): https://discord.gg/bzp87AHJy5\\nHow do I use this?\\nDownload package via command line pip install taskgen-ai\\nSet up your LLM and provide any API keys if needed\\nImport the required functions from taskgen and use them!\\nDifferences in LLM for Agentic Framework\\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) is consistent only if you specify very clearly what you want the Agent to do and give examples of what you want\\ngpt-4-turbo and more advanced models can perform better zero-shot without much examples\\nTaskGen is compatible with ChatGPT and similar models, but for more robust use, consider using gpt-4-turbo and better models\\n1. Agent Basics\\nCreate an agent by entering your agent\\'s name and description\\nAgents are task-based, so they will help generate subtasks to fulfil your main task\\nAgents are made to be non-verbose, so they will just focus only on task instruction (Much more efficient compared to conversational-based agentic frameworks like AutoGen)\\nAgent\\'s interactions will be stored into subtasks_completed by default, which will serve as a memory buffer for future interactions\\nInputs for Agent:\\nagent_name: String. Name of agent, hinting at what the agent does\\nagent_description: String. Short description of what the agent does\\nmax_subtasks: Int. Default: 5. The maximum number of subtasks the agent can have\\nverbose: Bool. Default: True. Whether to print out agent\\'s intermediate thoughts\\nAgent Internal Parameters:\\nTask: String. The task the agent has been assigned to - Defaults to \"No task assigned\"\\nSubtasks Completed: Dict. The keys are the subtask names and the values are the result of the respective subtask\\nIs Task Completed: Bool. Whether the current Task is completed\\nTask Running\\nreset(): Resets the Agent Internal Parameters and Subtasks Completed. You should do this at the start of every new task assigned to the Agent to minimise potential confusion of what has been done for this task versus previous tasks\\nrun(task: str, num_subtasks: int = max_subtasks): Performs the task. Do note that agent\\'s state will not be reset, so if you want to reset it, call reset() prior to running this. Runs the task for num_subtasks steps. If not specified, we will take the max_subtasks.\\nGive User Output\\nreply_user(query: str = \\'\\', stateful: bool = True): Using all information from subtasks, give a reply about the query to the user. If query is not given, then it replies based on the current task the agent is doing. If stateful is True, saves this query and reply into subtasks_completed\\nCheck status of Agent:\\nstatus(): Lists out Agent Name, Agent Description, Available Functions (default function is to use the LLM), Task, Subtasks Completed and Is Task Completed\\nExample Agent Creation\\nmy_agent = Agent(\\'Helpful assistant\\', \\'You are a generalist agent\\')\\nExample Agent Task Running - Split the assigned task into subtasks and execute each of them\\noutput = my_agent.run(\\'Give me 5 words rhyming with cool, and make a 4-sentence poem using them\\')\\nSubtask identified: Find 5 words that rhyme with \\'cool\\'\\nGetting LLM to perform the following task: Find 5 words that rhyme with \\'cool\\'\\npool, rule, fool, tool, school\\nSubtask identified: Compose a 4-sentence poem using the words \\'pool\\', \\'rule\\', \\'fool\\', \\'tool\\', and \\'school\\'\\nGetting LLM to perform the following task: Compose a 4-sentence poem using the words \\'pool\\', \\'rule\\', \\'fool\\', \\'tool\\', and \\'school\\'\\nIn the school, the golden rule is to never be a fool. Use your mind as a tool, and always follow the pool.\\nTask completed successfully!\\nCheck Agent\\'s Status\\nmy_agent.status()\\nAgent Name: Helpful assistant\\nAgent Description: You are a generalist agent\\nAvailable Functions: [\\'use_llm\\', \\'end_task\\']\\nTask: Give me 5 words rhyming with cool, and make a 4-sentence poem using them\\nSubtasks Completed:\\nSubtask: Find 5 words that rhyme with \\'cool\\'\\npool, rule, fool, tool, school\\nSubtask: Compose a 4-sentence poem using the words \\'pool\\', \\'rule\\', \\'fool\\', \\'tool\\', and \\'school\\'\\nIn the school, the golden rule is to never be a fool. Use your mind as a tool, and always follow the pool.\\nIs Task Completed: True\\nExample Agent Reply to User - Reference the subtasks\\' output to answer the user\\'s query\\noutput = my_agent.reply_user()\\nHere are 5 words that rhyme with \"cool\": pool, rule, fool, tool, school. Here is a 4-sentence poem using these words: \"In the school, the golden rule is to never be a fool. Use your mind as a tool, and always follow the pool.\"\\n2. Power Up your Agents - Bring in Functions (aka Tools)\\nFirst define the functions, either using class Function (see Tutorial 0), or just any Python function with input and output types defined in the signature and with a docstring\\nAfter creating your agent, use assign_functions to assign a list of functions of class Function, or general Python functions (which will be converted to AsyncFunction)\\nFunction names will be automatically inferred if not specified\\nProceed to run tasks by using run()\\n# This is an example of an LLM-based function (see Tutorial 0)\\nsentence_style = Function(fn_description = \\'Output a sentence with words <var1> and <var2> in the style of <var3>\\', output_format = {\\'output\\': \\'sentence\\'},\\n fn_name = \\'sentence_with_objects_entities_emotion\\',\\n llm = llm)\\n# This is an example of an external user-defined function (see Tutorial 0)\\ndef binary_to_decimal(binary_number: str) -> int:\\n \\'\\'\\'Converts binary_number to integer of base 10\\'\\'\\'\\n return int(str(binary_number), 2)\\n# Initialise your Agent\\nmy_agent = Agent(\\'Helpful assistant\\', \\'You are a generalist agent\\')\\n# Assign the functions\\nmy_agent.assign_functions([sentence_style, binary_to_decimal])\\n# Run the Agent\\noutput = my_agent.run(\\'First convert binary string 1001 to a number, then generate me a happy sentence with that number and a ball\\')\\nSubtask identified: Convert the binary number 1001 to decimal\\nCalling function binary_to_decimal with parameters {\\'x\\': \\'1001\\'}\\n{\\'output1\\': 9}\\nSubtask identified: Generate a happy sentence with the decimal number and a ball\\nCalling function sentence_with_objects_entities_emotion with parameters {\\'obj\\': \\'9\\', \\'entity\\': \\'ball\\', \\'emotion\\': \\'happy\\'}\\n{\\'output\\': \\'I am so happy with my 9 balls.\\'}\\nTask completed successfully!\\nApproach 1: Automatically Run your agent using run()\\nApproach 2: Manually select and use functions for your task\\nselect_function(task: str): Based on the task, output the next function name and input parameters\\nuse_function(function_name: str, function_params: dict, subtask: str = \\'\\', stateful: bool = True): Uses the function named function_name with function_params. stateful controls whether the output of this function will be saved to subtasks_completed under the key of subtask\\nAssign/Remove Functions:\\nassign_functions(function_list: list): Assigns a list of functions to the agent\\nremove_function(function_name: str): Removes function named function_name from the list of assigned functions\\nShow Functions:\\nlist_functions(): Returns the list of functions of the agent\\nprint_functions(): Prints the list of functions of the agent\\n3. AsyncAgent\\nAsyncAgent works the same way as Agent, only much faster due to parallelisation of tasks\\nIt can only be assigned functions of class AsyncFunction, or general Python functions (which will be converted to AsyncFunction)\\nIf you define your own AsyncFunction, you should define the fn_name as well if it is not an External Function\\nAs a rule of thumb, just add the await keyword to any function that you run with the AsyncAgent\\nExample LLM in Async Mode\\nasync def llm_async(system_prompt: str, user_prompt: str):\\n \\'\\'\\' Here, we use OpenAI for illustration, you can change it to your own LLM \\'\\'\\'\\n # ensure your LLM imports are all within this function\\n from openai import AsyncOpenAI\\n # define your own LLM here\\n client = AsyncOpenAI()\\n response = await client.chat.completions.create(\\n model=\\'gpt-3.5-turbo\\',\\n temperature = 0,\\n messages=[\\n {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\\n {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}\\n ]\\n )\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\nExample Agentic Workflow\\n# This is an example of an LLM-based function (see Tutorial 0)\\nsentence_style = AsyncFunction(fn_description = \\'Output a sentence with words <var1> and <var2> in the style of <var3>\\', output_format = {\\'output\\': \\'sentence\\'},\\n fn_name = \\'sentence_with_objects_entities_emotion\\', # you must define fn_name for LLM-based functions\\n llm = llm_async) # use an async LLM function\\n# This is an example of an external user-defined function (see Tutorial 0)\\ndef binary_to_decimal(binary_number: str) -> int:\\n \\'\\'\\'Converts binary_number to integer of base 10\\'\\'\\'\\n return int(str(binary_number), 2)\\n# Initialise your Agent\\nmy_agent = AsyncAgent(\\'Helpful assistant\\', \\'You are a generalist agent\\', llm = llm_async)\\n# Assign the functions\\nmy_agent.assign_functions([sentence_style, binary_to_decimal])\\n# Run the Agent\\noutput = await my_agent.run(\\'Generate me a happy sentence with a number and a ball. The number is b1001 converted to decimal\\')\\n4. Shared Variables\\n\"Because text is not enough\" - Anonymous\\nshared_variables is a dictionary, that is initialised in Agent (default empty dictionary), and can be referenced by any function of the agent (including Inner Agents and their functions)\\nThis can be useful for non-text modalitiies (e.g. audio, pdfs, image) and lengthy text modalities, which we do not want to output into subtasks_completed directly\\nTo use, simply define an External Function with shared_variables as the first input variable, from which you can access and modify shared_variables directly\\nThe agent will also be able to be self-referenced in the External Function via shared_variables[\\'agent\\'], so you can change the agent\\'s internal parameters via shared_variables\\nIf the function has no output because the output is stored in shared_variables, the default return value will be {\\'Status\\': \\'Completed\\'}\\nExample External Function using shared_variables\\n# Use shared_variables as input to your external function to access and modify the shared variables\\ndef generate_quotes(shared_variables, number_of_quotes: int, category: str):\\n \\'\\'\\' Generates number_of_quotes quotes about category \\'\\'\\'\\n # Retrieve from shared variables\\n my_quote_list = shared_variables[\\'Quote List\\']\\n # Generate the quotes\\n res = strict_json(system_prompt = f\\'\\'\\'Generate {number_of_quotes} sentences about {category}. \\nDo them in the format \"<Quote> - <Person>\", e.g. \"The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. - Walt Disney\"\\nEnsure your quotes contain only \\' within the quote, and are enclosed by \" \\'\\'\\',\\n user_prompt = \\'\\',\\n output_format = {\\'Quote List\\': f\\'list of {number_of_quotes} quotes, type: List[str]\\'},\\n llm = llm)\\n my_quote_list.extend([f\\'Category: {category}. \\'+ x for x in res[\\'Quote List\\']])\\n # Store back to shared variables\\n shared_variables[\\'Quote List\\'] = my_quote_list\\n5. Global Context\\nGlobal Context is a very powerful feature in TaskGen, as it allows the Agent to be updated with the latest environmental state before every decision it makes\\nIt also allows for learnings in shared_variables to be carried across tasks, making the Agent teachable and learn through experiences\\nA recommended practice is to always store the learnings of the Agent during the External Function call, and reset the Agent after each task, so that subtasks_completed will be as short as possible to avoid confusion to the Agent\\nThere are two ways to use Global Context, and both can be used concurrently:\\nglobal_context\\nIf all you need in the global context is shared_variables without any modification to it, then you can use global_context\\nglobal_context is a string with <shared_variables_name> enclosed with <>. These <> will be replaced with the actual variable in shared_variables\\nget_global_context\\nget_global_context is a function that takes in the agent\\'s internal parameters (self) and outputs a string to the LLM to append to the prompts of any LLM-based calls internally, e.g. get_next_subtask, use_llm, reply_to_user\\nYou have full flexibility to access anything the agent knows and process the shared_variables as required and configure a global prompt to the agent\\nExample for global_context : Inventory Manager\\nWe can use Global Context to keep track of inventory state\\nWe simply get the functions add_item_to_inventory and remove_item_from_inventory to modify the shared_variable named Inventory\\nNote we can also put rule-based checks like checking if item is in inventory before removing inside the function\\nEven after task reset, the Agent still knows the inventory because of Global Context\\ndef add_item_to_inventory(shared_variables, item: str) -> str:\\n \\'\\'\\' Adds item to inventory, and returns outcome of action \\'\\'\\'\\n shared_variables[\\'Inventory\\'].append(item)\\n return f\\'{item} successfully added to Inventory\\'\\ndef remove_item_from_inventory(shared_variables, item: str) -> str:\\n \\'\\'\\' Removes item from inventory and returns outcome of action \\'\\'\\'\\n if item in shared_variables[\\'Inventory\\']:\\n shared_variables[\\'Inventory\\'].remove(item)\\n return f\\'{item} successfully removed from Inventory\\'\\n else:\\n return f\\'{item} not found in Inventory, unable to remove\\'\\nagent = Agent(\\'Inventory Manager\\', \\'Adds and removes items in Inventory. Only able to remove items if present in Inventory\\',\\n shared_variables = {\\'Inventory\\': []},\\n global_context = \\'Inventory: <Inventory>\\', # Add in Global Context here with shared_variables Inventory\\n llm = llm).assign_functions([add_item_to_inventory, remove_item_from_inventory])\\nOther Features\\nThere are other features like Memory (Tutorial 3), Hierarchical Agents (Tutorial 4), CodeGen and External Function Interfacing (Tutorial 5), Conversation Class (Tutorial 6)\\nThese extend the baseline features of TaskGen and you are encouraged to take a look at the Tutorials for more information.\\nKnown Limitations\\ngpt-3.5-turbo is not that great with mathematical functions for Agents. Use gpt-4-turbo or better for more consistent results\\ngpt-3.5-turbo is not that great with Memory (Tutorial 3). Use gpt-4-turbo or better for more consistent results\\nContributing to the project\\nTest locally\\nClone the repository\\nIf using a virtual environment, activate it\\ncd into taskgen repository\\nInstall the package via command line pip install -e .\\nNow you can import the package and use it in your code\\nSubmitting a pull request\\nFork the repository\\nCreate a new branch\\nMake your changes\\nPush your changes to your fork\\nSubmit a pull request\\nWhat are we looking out for?\\nContributing example Agents and Functions. Agents can now be contributed easily using agent.contribute_agent() and the entire Agent code with all the functions and memory will be converted to text-based code and put on the TaskGen GitHub. Do share your use cases actively so that other people can benefit :) These Agents can be downloaded by others via agent.load_community_agent(agent_name)\\nJupyter Notebooks showcasing what could be done with the framework for something useful. Let your imagination guide you, we look forward to see what you create\\nOther Known Limitations - Do test the framework out extensively and note its failure cases. We will see if we can address them, if not we will put them in Known Limitations.\\n(For the prompt engineer). If you could find a better way to make the prompts work, let us know directly - we do need to test this out across all Tutorial Jupyter Notebooks to make sure that it really works with existing datasets. Also, if you are using other LLMs beside OpenAI, and find the prompts do not work as well - try to rejig your own prompts and let us know as well!\\nAbout\\n Task-based Agentic Framework using StrictJSON as the core\\nResources\\n Readme\\nLicense\\n MIT license\\nActivity\\nCustom properties\\nStars\\n100\\n stars\\nWatchers\\n5\\n watching\\nForks\\n16\\n forks\\n Report repository\\n Releases\\nNo releases published\\n Packages\\n 0\\n Contributors\\n 7\\nLanguages\\nJupyter Notebook\\n95.6%\\nPython\\n4.4%\\nFooter\\n © 2024 GitHub,\\xa0Inc.\\nFooter navigation\\nTerms\\nPrivacy\\nSecurity\\nStatus\\nDocs\\nContact\\n Manage cookies\\n Do not share my personal information\\n You can’t perform that action at this time.'}\n",

By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\\nPlease refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring you agents\\' connections to models.\\nHow CrewAI Compares\\nAutogen: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents\\' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\\nChatDev: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\\nCrewAI\\'s Advantage: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen\\'s conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI\\'s processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.\\nContribution\\nCrewAI is open-source and we welcome contributions.

TaskGen - is largely complete!\\nNoteable features include:\\nSplitting of Tasks into subtasks for bite-sized solutions for each subtask\\nSingle Agent with LLM Functions\\nSingle Agent with External Functions\\nMeta Agent with Inner Agents as Functions\\nShared Variables for multi-modality support\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) over Function space\\nMemory to provide additional task-based prompts for task\\nGlobal Context for configuring your own prompts + add persistent variables\\nAsync mode for Agent, Function and strict_json added\\nCommunity Uploading and Downloading of Agent and Functions\\nI am quite sure that this is the best open-source agentic framework for task-based execution out there!\\nExisting frameworks like AutoGen rely too much on conversational text which is lengthy and not targeted.\\nTaskGen uses StrictJSON (JSON parser with type checking and more!) as the core, and agents are efficient and are able to do Chain of Thought natively using JSON keys and descriptions as a guide.\\nWhat can you do to help:\\nStar the github so more people can use it (It\\'s open source and free to use, even commercially!)\\nContribute your favourite external function integrations so that it can be much more boilerplate for others to use :)\\nContribute template Jupyter Notebooks for your favourite use cases :)\\nI can\\'t wait to see what this new framework can do for you!\\nBenefits of JSON messaging over agentic frameworks using conversational free-text like AutoGen\\nJSON format helps do Chain-of-Thought prompting naturally and is less verbose than free text\\nJSON format allows natural parsing of multiple output fields by agents\\nStrictJSON helps to ensure all output fields are there and of the right format required for downstream processing\\nTutorials and Community Support\\nCreated: 17 Feb 2024 by John Tan Chong Min\\nCo-developer / Lead Contributor: Prince Saroj\\nCollaborators welcome\\nDiscussion Channel (my discord - John\\'s AI Group): https://discord.gg/bzp87AHJy5\\nHow do I use this?\\nDownload package via command line pip install taskgen-ai\\nSet up your LLM and provide any API keys if needed\\nImport the required functions from taskgen and use them!\\nDifferences in LLM for Agentic Framework\\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) is consistent only if you specify very clearly what you want the Agent to do and give examples of what you want\\ngpt-4-turbo and more advanced models can perform better zero-shot without much examples\\nTaskGen is compatible with ChatGPT and similar models, but for more robust use, consider using gpt-4-turbo and better models\\n1. Agent Basics\\nCreate an agent by entering your agent\\'s name and description\\nAgents are task-based, so they will help generate subtasks to fulfil your main task\\nAgents are made to be non-verbose, so they will just focus only on task instruction (Much more efficient compared to conversational-based agentic frameworks like AutoGen)\\nAgent\\'s interactions will be stored into subtasks_completed by default, which will serve as a memory buffer for future interactions\\nInputs for Agent:\\nagent_name: String. Name of agent, hinting at what the agent does\\nagent_description: String. Short description of what the agent does\\nmax_subtasks: Int. Default: 5. The maximum number of subtasks the agent can have\\nverbose: Bool. Default: True. Whether to print out agent\\'s intermediate thoughts\\nAgent Internal Parameters:\\nTask: String. The task the agent has been assigned to - Defaults to \"No task assigned\"\\nSubtasks Completed: Dict. The keys are the subtask names and the values are the result of the respective subtask\\nIs Task Completed: Bool. Whether the current Task is completed\\nTask Running\\nreset(): Resets the Agent Internal Parameters and Subtasks Completed. You should do this at the start of every new task assigned to the Agent to minimise potential confusion of what has been done for this task versus previous tasks\\nrun(task: str, num_subtasks: int = max_subtasks): Performs the task. Do note that agent\\'s state will not be reset, so if you want to reset it, call reset() prior to running this. Runs the task for num_subtasks steps. If not specified, we will take the max_subtasks.\\nGive User Output\\nreply_user(query: str = \\'\\', stateful: bool = True): Using all information from subtasks, give a reply about the query to the user.

Here is a 4-sentence poem using these words: \"In the school, the golden rule is to never be a fool. Use your mind as a tool, and always follow the pool.\"\\n2. Power Up your Agents - Bring in Functions (aka Tools)\\nFirst define the functions, either using class Function (see Tutorial 0), or just any Python function with input and output types defined in the signature and with a docstring\\nAfter creating your agent, use assign_functions to assign a list of functions of class Function, or general Python functions (which will be converted to AsyncFunction)\\nFunction names will be automatically inferred if not specified\\nProceed to run tasks by using run()\\n# This is an example of an LLM-based function (see Tutorial 0)\\nsentence_style = Function(fn_description = \\'Output a sentence with words <var1> and <var2> in the style of <var3>\\', output_format = {\\'output\\': \\'sentence\\'},\\n fn_name = \\'sentence_with_objects_entities_emotion\\',\\n llm = llm)\\n# This is an example of an external user-defined function (see Tutorial 0)\\ndef binary_to_decimal(binary_number: str) -> int:\\n \\'\\'\\'Converts binary_number to integer of base 10\\'\\'\\'\\n return int(str(binary_number), 2)\\n# Initialise your Agent\\nmy_agent = Agent(\\'Helpful assistant\\', \\'You are a generalist agent\\')\\n# Assign the functions\\nmy_agent.assign_functions([sentence_style, binary_to_decimal])\\n# Run the Agent\\noutput = my_agent.run(\\'First convert binary string 1001 to a number, then generate me a happy sentence with that number and a ball\\')\\nSubtask identified: Convert the binary number 1001 to decimal\\nCalling function binary_to_decimal with parameters {\\'x\\': \\'1001\\'}\\n{\\'output1\\': 9}\\nSubtask identified: Generate a happy sentence with the decimal number and a ball\\nCalling function sentence_with_objects_entities_emotion with parameters {\\'obj\\': \\'9\\', \\'entity\\': \\'ball\\', \\'emotion\\': \\'happy\\'}\\n{\\'output\\': \\'I am so happy with my 9 balls.\\'}\\nTask completed successfully!\\nApproach 1: Automatically Run your agent using run()\\nApproach 2: Manually select and use functions for your task\\nselect_function(task: str): Based on the task, output the next function name and input parameters\\nuse_function(function_name: str, function_params: dict, subtask: str = \\'\\', stateful: bool = True): Uses the function named function_name with function_params. stateful controls whether the output of this function will be saved to subtasks_completed under the key of subtask\\nAssign/Remove Functions:\\nassign_functions(function_list: list): Assigns a list of functions to the agent\\nremove_function(function_name: str): Removes function named function_name from the list of assigned functions\\nShow Functions:\\nlist_functions(): Returns the list of functions of the agent\\nprint_functions(): Prints the list of functions of the agent\\n3. AsyncAgent\\nAsyncAgent works the same way as Agent, only much faster due to parallelisation of tasks\\nIt can only be assigned functions of class AsyncFunction, or general Python functions (which will be converted to AsyncFunction)\\nIf you define your own AsyncFunction, you should define the fn_name as well if it is not an External Function\\nAs a rule of thumb, just add the await keyword to any function that you run with the AsyncAgent\\nExample LLM in Async Mode\\nasync def llm_async(system_prompt: str, user_prompt: str):\\n \\'\\'\\' Here, we use OpenAI for illustration, you can change it to your own LLM \\'\\'\\'\\n # ensure your LLM imports are all within this function\\n from openai import AsyncOpenAI\\n # define your own LLM here\\n client = AsyncOpenAI()\\n response = await client.chat.completions.create(\\n model=\\'gpt-3.5-turbo\\',\\n temperature = 0,\\n messages=[\\n {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\\n {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt}\\n ]\\n )\\n return response.choices[0].message.content\\nExample Agentic Workflow\\n# This is an example of an LLM-based function (see Tutorial 0)\\nsentence_style = AsyncFunction(fn_description = \\'Output a sentence with words <var1> and <var2> in the style of <var3>\\', output_format = {\\'output\\': \\'sentence\\'},\\n fn_name = \\'sentence_with_objects_entities_emotion\\', # you must define fn_name for LLM-based functions\\n llm = llm_async) # use an async LLM function\\n# This is an example of an external user-defined function (see Tutorial 0)\\ndef binary_to_decimal(binary_number: str) -> int:\\n \\'\\'\\'Converts binary_number to integer of base 10\\'\\'\\'\\n return int(str(binary_number), 2)\\n# Initialise your Agent\\nmy_agent = AsyncAgent(\\'Helpful assistant\\', \\'You are a generalist agent\\', llm = llm_async)\\n# Assign the functions\\nmy_agent.assign_functions([sentence_style, binary_to_decimal])\\n# Run the Agent\\noutput = await my_agent.run(\\'Generate me a happy sentence with a number and a ball. The number is b1001 converted to decimal\\')\\n4. Shared Variables\\n\"Because text is not enough\" - Anonymous\\nshared_variables is a dictionary, that is initialised in Agent (default empty dictionary), and can be referenced by any function of the agent (including Inner Agents and their functions)\\nThis can be useful for non-text modalitiies (e.g. audio, pdfs, image) and lengthy text modalities, which we do not want to output into subtasks_completed directly\\nTo use, simply define an External Function with shared_variables as the first input variable, from which you can access and modify shared_variables directly\\nThe agent will also be able to be self-referenced in the External Function via shared_variables[\\'agent\\'], so you can change the agent\\'s internal parameters via shared_variables\\nIf the function has no output because the output is stored in shared_variables, the default return value will be {\\'Status\\': \\'Completed\\'}\\nExample External Function using shared_variables\\n# Use shared_variables as input to your external function to access and modify the shared variables\\ndef generate_quotes(shared_variables, number_of_quotes: int, category: str):\\n \\'\\'\\' Generates number_of_quotes quotes about category \\'\\'\\'\\n # Retrieve from shared variables\\n my_quote_list = shared_variables[\\'Quote List\\']\\n # Generate the quotes\\n res = strict_json(system_prompt = f\\'\\'\\'Generate {number_of_quotes} sentences about {category}. \\nDo them in the format \"<Quote> - <Person>\", e.g. \"The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. - Walt Disney\"\\nEnsure your quotes contain only \\' within the quote, and are enclosed by \" \\'\\'\\',\\n user_prompt = \\'\\',\\n output_format = {\\'Quote List\\': f\\'list of {number_of_quotes} quotes, type: List[str]\\'},\\n llm = llm)\\n my_quote_list.extend([f\\'Category: {category}. \\'+ x for x in res[\\'Quote List\\']])\\n # Store back to shared variables\\n shared_variables[\\'Quote List\\'] = my_quote_list\\n5. Global Context\\nGlobal Context is a very powerful feature in TaskGen, as it allows the Agent to be updated with the latest environmental state before every decision it makes\\nIt also allows for learnings in shared_variables to be carried across tasks, making the Agent teachable and learn through experiences\\nA recommended practice is to always store the learnings of the Agent during the External Function call, and reset the Agent after each task, so that subtasks_completed will be as short as possible to avoid confusion to the Agent\\nThere are two ways to use Global Context, and both can be used concurrently:\\nglobal_context\\nIf all you need in the global context is shared_variables without any modification to it, then you can use global_context\\nglobal_context is a string with <shared_variables_name> enclosed with <>. These <> will be replaced with the actual variable in shared_variables\\nget_global_context\\nget_global_context is a function that takes in the agent\\'s internal parameters (self) and outputs a string to the LLM to append to the prompts of any LLM-based calls internally, e.g. get_next_subtask, use_llm, reply_to_user\\nYou have full flexibility to access anything the agent knows and process the shared_variables as required and configure a global prompt to the agent\\nExample for global_context : Inventory Manager\\nWe can use Global Context to keep track of inventory state\\nWe simply get the functions add_item_to_inventory and remove_item_from_inventory to modify the shared_variable named Inventory\\nNote we can also put rule-based checks like checking if item is in inventory before removing inside the function\\nEven after task reset, the Agent still knows the inventory because of Global Context\\ndef add_item_to_inventory(shared_variables, item: str) -> str:\\n \\'\\'\\' Adds item to inventory, and returns outcome of action \\'\\'\\'\\n shared_variables[\\'Inventory\\'].append(item)\\n return f\\'{item} successfully added to Inventory\\'\\ndef remove_item_from_inventory(shared_variables, item: str) -> str:\\n \\'\\'\\' Removes item from inventory and returns outcome of action \\'\\'\\'\\n if item in shared_variables[\\'Inventory\\']:\\n shared_variables[\\'Inventory\\'].remove(item)\\n return f\\'{item} successfully removed from Inventory\\'\\n else:\\n return f\\'{item} not found in Inventory, unable to remove\\'\\nagent = Agent(\\'Inventory Manager\\', \\'Adds and removes items in Inventory. Only able to remove items if present in Inventory\\',\\n shared_variables = {\\'Inventory\\': []},\\n global_context = \\'Inventory: <Inventory>\\', # Add in Global Context here with shared_variables Inventory\\n llm = llm).assign_functions([add_item_to_inventory, remove_item_from_inventory])\\nOther Features\\nThere are other features like Memory (Tutorial 3), Hierarchical Agents (Tutorial 4), CodeGen and External Function Interfacing (Tutorial 5), Conversation Class (Tutorial 6)\\nThese extend the baseline features of TaskGen and you are encouraged to take a look at the Tutorials for more information.\\nKnown Limitations\\ngpt-3.5-turbo is not that great with mathematical functions for Agents. Use gpt-4-turbo or better for more consistent results\\ngpt-3.5-turbo is not that great with Memory (Tutorial 3). Use gpt-4-turbo or better for more consistent results\\nContributing to the project\\nTest locally\\nClone the repository\\nIf using a virtual environment, activate it\\ncd into taskgen repository\\nInstall the package via command line pip install -e .\\nNow you can import the package and use it in your code\\nSubmitting a pull request\\nFork the repository\\nCreate a new branch\\nMake your changes\\nPush your changes to your fork\\nSubmit a pull request\\nWhat are we looking out for?\\nContributing example Agents and Functions. Agents can now be contributed easily using agent.contribute_agent() and the entire Agent code with all the functions and memory will be converted to text-based code and put on the TaskGen GitHub. Do share your use cases actively so that other people can benefit :) These Agents can be downloaded by others via agent.load_community_agent(agent_name)\\nJupyter Notebooks showcasing what could be done with the framework for something useful. Let your imagination guide you, we look forward to see what you create\\nOther Known Limitations - Do test the framework out extensively and note its failure cases. We will see if we can address them, if not we will put them in Known Limitations.\\n(For the prompt engineer). If you could find a better way to make the prompts work, let us know directly - we do need to test this out across all Tutorial Jupyter Notebooks to make sure that it really works with existing datasets. Also, if you are using other LLMs beside OpenAI, and find the prompts do not work as well - try to rejig your own prompts and let us know as well!\\nAbout\\n Task-based Agentic Framework using StrictJSON as the core\\nResources\\n Readme\\nLicense\\n MIT license\\nActivity\\nCustom properties\\nStars\\n100\\n stars\\nWatchers\\n5\\n watching\\nForks\\n16\\n forks\\n Report repository\\n Releases\\nNo releases published\\n Packages\\n 0\\n Contributors\\n 7\\nLanguages\\nJupyter Notebook\\n95.6%\\nPython\\n4.4%\\nFooter\\n © 2024 GitHub,\\xa0Inc.\\nFooter navigation\\nTerms\\nPrivacy\\nSecurity\\nStatus\\nDocs\\nContact\\n Manage cookies\\n Do not share my personal information\\n You can’t perform that action at this time.'},\n",

Whether you\\'re building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.\\nGetting Started\\nTo get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:\\n1. Installation\\npip install crewai\\nIf you want to install the \\'crewai\\' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command: pip install \\'crewai[tools]\\'. This command installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function.\"\\npip install \\'crewai[tools]\\'\\n2.

See more about the processes here.\\nKey Features\\nRole-Based Agent Design: Customize agents with specific roles, goals, and tools.\\nAutonomous Inter-Agent Delegation: Agents can autonomously delegate tasks and inquire amongst themselves, enhancing problem-solving efficiency.\\nFlexible Task Management: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.\\nProcesses Driven: Currently only supports sequential task execution and hierarchical processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.\\nSave output as file: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.\\nParse output as Pydantic or Json: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.\\nWorks with Open Source Models: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring your agents\\' connections to models, even ones running locally!\\nExamples\\nYou can test different real life examples of AI crews in the crewAI-examples repo:\\nLanding Page Generator\\nHaving Human input on the execution\\nTrip Planner\\nStock Analysis\\nQuick Tutorial\\nWrite Job Descriptions\\nCheck out code for this example or watch a video below:\\nTrip Planner\\nCheck out code for this example or watch a video below:\\nStock Analysis\\nCheck out code for this example or watch a video below:\\nConnecting Your Crew to a Model\\ncrewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\\nPlease refer to the Connect crewAI to LLMs page for details on configuring you agents\\' connections to models.\\nHow CrewAI Compares\\nAutogen: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents\\' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\\nChatDev: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\\nCrewAI\\'s Advantage: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen\\'s conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI\\'s processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.\\nContribution\\nCrewAI is open-source and we welcome contributions.

       " 'The analysis of the scraped data from both TaskGen and CrewAI reveals several key differences between the two frameworks:\\n\\n1. **Core Functionality**:\\n   - **TaskGen** is primarily focused on a task-based agentic framework that utilizes StrictJSON as its core. It emphasizes breaking down tasks into subtasks for efficient execution and supports various functionalities like memory, shared variables, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\n   - **CrewAI**, on the other hand, is designed for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents.

He graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965 before earning his law degree from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate and defeated incumbent Donald Trump. He is the oldest president in U.S. history and the first to have a female vice president.\\nAs president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the Taliban seizing control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned the actions of Hamas as terrorism, announced military support for Israel and sent limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. \\nIn April 2023, Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election and became the presumptive nominee.
