    "# Tutorial 5 - Global Context (Advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent takes in one additional parameter: `get_global_context`\n",
    "- This is a function that takes in the agent's internal parameters (self) and outputs a string to the LLM to append to the prompts of any LLM-based calls internally, e.g. `get_next_subtask`, `use_llm`, `reply_to_user`\n",
    "- You have full flexibility to access anything the agent knows and configure a global prompt to the agent\n",
    "- This can also be used to wrap TaskGen around with a conversational interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uses\n",
    "- Used mainly to provide persistent variables to an agent that is not conveniently stored in `subtasks_completed`, e.g. ingredients remaining, location in grid for robot\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "- Implementing your own specific instructions to the default planner prompt\n",
    "    - Implement your own memory-based RAG / global prompt instruction if you need more than what the default prompt can achieve\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "- Avoid Multiple Similar Subtasks in `subtasks_history`\n",
    "    - If you have multiple similar subtask names, then it is likely the Agent can be confused and think it has already done the subtask\n",
    "    - In this case, you can disambiguate by resetting the agent and store the persistent information in `shared_variables` and provide it to the agent using `get_global_context`"
